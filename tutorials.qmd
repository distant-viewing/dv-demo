# Tutorials {#part-methods .unnumbered}

This section contains three tutorials that show how to
use Python to apply computational techniques to visual
materials. The first tutorial provides a gentle introduction
to the structure of digital images and how to work with them.
The second tutorial expands this to video files. The third is
focused on how to build your own corpus of visual data.
