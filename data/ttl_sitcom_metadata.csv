Notes: 

Rehearsal for the pilot was to begin on November 22, 1963, but was ultimately postponed due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Filming was completed December 6 of that year.
Elizabeth Montgomery would give birth to her first child seven months later, on July 24, 1964.
Nancy Kovack's character of Sheila was originally intended to be an occasionally recurring nemesis of Darrin and Samantha,[citation needed] but did not appear again until the fourth season episode ""Snob in the Grass"".
Gene Blakely's character of Dave, a drinking companion of Darrin's, would recur very occasionally in seasons 1 through 4, as would Paul Barselow's bartender character (who at various times was credited as Al, Joe, Pete or Max). C. Lindsay Workman would also appear in a few later episodes as Dr. Koblin (the character he plays here), as well as playing other roles throughout the series run.
Narrated by an uncredited José Ferrer, who would also narrate episodes 2 and 4 before being dropped from the show."
