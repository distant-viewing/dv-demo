Welcome! Distant Viewing Scripts is a free, open-source website that
provides tutorials and scripts for doing computational analysis with
visual and multimodal data. All of the code is written using the Python
programming language, with open-source models and freely accessible
data. Please use the table of contents navigation n the left to access
the pages of the site. 

Distant Viewing Scripts is designed to complement the
[Distant Viewing Explorer](https://distant-viewing.github.io/dvgui-demo),
which provides web-based tools for applying and visualizing AI models
directly in the browser. For those new to programming and/or the application
of computer vision models, we recommend starting with the Distant Viewing Explorer
to get a quick hands-on sense of the methods and approaches before continuing
with the material here.

The first section includes several longer tutorials. The first tutorial
gives a gentle introduction to image analysis. It includes slides and discussion
questions, making it an excellent starting point for both classroom use
as well as self-study. The second tutorial expands the techniques from the
first to include working with moving images. The final tutorial explores
how to create and organize your own visual collections.

The remainder of the scripts are grouped by data type, with one page dedicated
to a different type of model. Many of these mirror the interactive visualizations
from the Distant Viewing Explorer website. The code should be easy to adapt to
your own datasets and to expand with other models of a similar kind that are
available online.
